# minimalist-youtube
YouTube for people who just want to watch a video and not be bombarded with recommendations, updates, and Will Smith.

Hi! Do you sometimes visit YouTube with the intent of looking for and watching a single video, but end up staying for hours because YouTube recommendations are too tempting? Do you start typing something in the search bar, but autocomplete gives you something more interesting and shoves you down into a rabbit hole? Do you have 0 self-control and willpower? Me too.
